- **User-Friendly Setup**: Easy-to-follow setup process with QR code generation for authenticator apps.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Administrators can choose which methods to enable and configure security parameters.
- **Session Security**: Secure session management with proper cleanup and validation.

## Supported Methods

## How It Works

### Setup Process
1. **Administrator enables the plugin** and configures available methods
2. **Users access their profile** to set up two-factor authentication
3. **For external apps**: Scan QR code with authenticator app and verify setup
4. **For email**: Verify email address and test code delivery
5. **Save recovery codes** (for external app method) in a secure location

### Login Process
1. **Enter username and password** as usual
2. **System redirects to 2FA verification** if authentication is enabled
3. **Enter 6-digit code** from your chosen method:
   - From authenticator app (external method)
   - From email received (email method)
   - Or use a recovery code (external method only)
4. **Access granted** upon successful verification
